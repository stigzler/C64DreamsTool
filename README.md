An app as an add-on to Zombeaver's excellent C64Dreams project. Features:

* Makes installation into existing (or indeed vanilla) Launchbox installations a lot easier (fully automated). 
* Automates adding other C64 games to the C64Dreams collection without having to mess about with .bat, .vbs, .ahk files. Also automates adding to the Launchbox database (not having to add it manually).
* Lets you search the C64Dreams collection for specific games in-app rather than having to launch Launchbox each time.
* Fixes broken Images for Platforms, Platform Categories and Playlists. Also lets you use your own images and automates the installation to launchbox process (GIMP template attached to this post for convenience).
